I didn't know anything about web development so, first of all, I go and watch a reference video but I didn't understand that then I asked my sister then she gave me some know about HTML. Then I search for some things about it on google I got things on greeks for greeks, youtube but after all it too I got to troubleshoot and problems but research about and searches about tags etc and finally, I prepared a website with very few features.
